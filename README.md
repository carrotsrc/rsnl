# RSNL

This is the beginning of a library for netlink and libnl-3.

The plan is to structure it out similar to libnl (core, route, genl, nf), but appropiately abstracted in ways that make it geared more toward being a rust interface.

#### License

Out of respect to Libnl, the library is licensed under LGPL
